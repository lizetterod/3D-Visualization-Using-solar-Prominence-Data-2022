# 3D-Visualization-Using-solar-Prominence-Data-2022

  Solar prominences are celestial mass eruptions that extend far beyond the earth. Solar prominences emit electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation causes damage to satellites and electrical faults as what could have been seen in the geomagnetic solar storms of 2012. After the solar storms of 2012 SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory) captured a glimpse of the multiple CME’s (Celestial Mass Eruptions) in the heliosphere.
  
  Applications like SunPy and pfsspy make 3D visualization of solar prominences possible through dependencies: GFortran, Zeep, DrMS and Matplotlibs. The visualization of data will show a 3D cartesian coordinate system or a simple x, y, z plane as the prominence becomes rendered in a series of elaborate calculations of electromagnetism within the sun's atmosphere.
  
  Upon this speculation comes the common question: Will SunPy in Ubuntu through pfsspy support SDO’s solar prominence data through 3D visualization? H1) SunPy in Ubuntu through pfsspy will support SDO’s solar prominence data through 3D visualization in a comparison method where 2D data analysis results in a 3D model of magnetic prominence lines of the outer interior to exterior regions of the sun.
  
  Using the internet a website containing the solar flare data and plausible code was located researching Ubuntu environments. The website that was found for solar data was Stanford JSOC (Joint Science Operations Center). Code for this was found online and is named under pfsspy documentation. The code was entered into linux using user environments SunPy and Ubuntu, a Python server for analysis. The model was found conclusive as the hypothesis stated.
